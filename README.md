# Light Curves produced by Starspots

Because of the concentration of magnetic currents on the Sun, we are able to observe sunspots on its surface. 
This causes variability in the total brightness of the star. During the study of neighboring stars by the Kepler 
mission, scientists collected very precise measurements of the brightness of many stars every thirty minutes for four years. 
Some of the data comes from more magnetically active stars, which do not look like the light curves produced by the
Sunâ€™s activity. To understand what these light curves tell us about spots on other stars, we wrote a program that 
produces light curves from spots with specified characteristics such as their position, size, and rotation period.
Because the Sun rotates with different periods from the equator to the pole, we would also like to know if other 
stars behave the same way, and more about when and how it occurs. As a first step in this project, we have 
modeled certain situations to understand more their light curve behavior.
